## 📈 Time Series Analysis for Sales Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

This project leverages advanced time series forecasting techniques to predict future **superstore sales** and support **inventory management decisions**. It includes classical statistical models, machine learning methods, and hybrid techniques to ensure accurate and actionable insights.

### ⚙️ Project Description

The project investigates historical sales data and applies time series forecasting methods to:

* Predict future sales trends
* Identify seasonal patterns and anomalies
* Improve inventory planning and reduce stockouts/overstockin

### 🔢 Models Applied

#### ✔️ **ARIMA / SARIMA**

* Captures linear trends and seasonality
* Good baseline for time series forecasting

#### ✔️ **Prophet (by Facebook)**

* Handles seasonality, holidays, and trend shifts
* Best-performing model in this project (based on RMSE/MAE)

#### ✔️ **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**

* Deep learning model for capturing long-term dependencies
* Suitable for complex, non-linear patterns in sales

#### ✔️ **Hybrid SARIMA + LSTM**

* Combines strengths of statistical and deep learning methods
* Tested to improve predictive performance over individual models

### 🚀 Business Impact

This time series forecasting project helps businesses:

* 📊 **Anticipate Sales Demand:** Plan ahead using accurate forecasts
* 📅 **Improve Inventory Efficiency:** Reduce holding costs and avoid lost sales
* 📆 **Enable Data-Driven Planning:** Align supply chain and marketing strategies
* 💪 **Enhance Decision-Making:** Back strategic choices with data

### 🧠 Tools & Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Statsmodels, pmdarima
* Facebook Prophet
* TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM)
* Scikit-learn (evaluation metrics)
* Jupyter Notebook


### 📊 Key Results

* Prophet model showed the **lowest RMSE and MAE**, outperforming ARIMA and LSTM individually.
* Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM model was tested but did not outperform Prophet in this case.
